# Xplorer64 - Nintendo Cheat Cartridge Resources

Information and resources on the Xplorer64 Cheat Cartridge for the Nintendo 64.

Ive started to gather on the cartridge itself, pinouts, tool and other information. Much of this information is either missing, never been documented publically or currently hosted on old websites and forums to see what capabilities it has and what it is capable of.

There will also be a seperate repo called xp64. This is an experiment which uses a RaspberryPi single board computer to communicate with the cart using the RaspberryPi GPIO inputs/outputs.
