Information and resources on the Xplorer64 Cheat Cartridge for the Nintendo 64.

Ive started to gather on the cartridge itself, pinouts, tool and other information. Much of this information is currently hosted on websites and forums around the internet and felt it was time to give this long forgotten cart some attention and love.

There will also be a seperate repo called xp64. This is an experiment which uses a RaspberryPi single board computer to communicate with the cart using the RaspberryPi GPIO inputs/outputs.
