# Xplorer64 - Nintendo Cheat Cartridge Resources

Information and resources on the Xplorer64 Cheat Cartridge for the Nintendo 64.

After obtaining one of these cartridges, and being a massive fan of its PSX counterpart.. I thought it time that the Xplorer64 got some love.

Looking around on the internet there is little information on them at all.

Ive started to gather on the cartridge itself, pinouts, tool and other information. Much of this information is either missing, never been documented publically or currently hosted on old websites and forums to see what capabilities it has and what it is capable of.

# xp64 - Utility for RaspberryPi

There will also be a seperate utility called xp64 that I am currently working on.

I now only have one PC with a parallel port.. and its got to go.. So this is an experiment which uses a RaspberryPi single board computer to communicate with the Xplorer64 using the RaspberryPi GPIO inputs/outputs.

That will probably be limited to flash updating and nothing else.. so at least you should be able to flash a rom with a new cheatlist if needed.
